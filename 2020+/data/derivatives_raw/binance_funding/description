Source: Binance Futures API (fapi/v1/fundingRate)
Period: 2020-01-01 → present
Granularity: 8-hour intervals (Binance funding schedule)

Columns:
- symbol        : Futures trading pair (here BTCUSDT perpetual)
- fundingTime   : UTC timestamp of the funding event (every 8h)
- fundingRate   : Funding rate applied at that timestamp (decimal)
- markPrice     : Mark price at funding time (NULL in this export, can be included if available)

Notes:
- This is the **canonical funding rate dataset** used by Binance for PnL calculations.
- fundingRate values show who pays who:
  • Positive → longs pay shorts

- markPrice is NULL here, but if available, it anchors the funding calculation.
- For analysis, you can resample/aggregate this into daily averages or merge with OI, price, and taker ratios.
