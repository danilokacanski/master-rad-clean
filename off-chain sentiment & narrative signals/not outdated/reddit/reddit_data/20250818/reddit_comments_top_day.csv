When you buy bitcoin, you are buying it from a person who has listed a price they're willing to sell for. Hundreds of thousands of people list their sell price across thousands of exchanges and it gets bought by people for varying prices constantly every second.

When Google says the price is $115,000, it's taking it from either a single exchange or more likely an index that is an average price across many exchanges. Just because that's an average doesn't mean you're going to get that exact price at the moment you hit the Purchase button from your one single exchange.

And as others say, depending on the exchange, they may be adding fees and spread.  While you want to avoid paying unnecessary additional fees, in general don't get married to a number from an index.

Start Here:

In all things, you have to start with understanding the problem, before the solution will even make sense, and so many in our society don't even know the problem exists. That's by design. The truth of money has been cleverly hidden in plain sight.

Primer:

The Creation of the Federal Reserve - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mjgu7c/americas\_greatest\_heist\_the\_creation\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mjgu7c/americas_greatest_heist_the_creation_of_the/)

I have created a list of videos to give you a strong foundation, you should power through these videos, but most importantly, clips 1 & 3.

// -- Understanding the Problem -- \\

Clip 1 • Understanding Money: The difference between “Currency” & “Money”.. What is sound money, and why gold (and now bitcoin) fits this description (This series was originally made in 2010, before bitcoin was well known). Feel free to watch all 10 videos in the series in your spare time, but if you do anything, at least watch the 1st vid in the series. (This might be the most important video here) [https://youtu.be/DyV0OfU3-FU?si=OqJ93-gHpcQjsvRH](https://youtu.be/DyV0OfU3-FU?si=OqJ93-gHpcQjsvRH)

Clip 2 • Where printing money is headed: Inflation & hyper inflation - the end result of the use of Fiat currency [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNNUVEfoNmE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNNUVEfoNmE)

// -- Understanding the Solution -- \\

Clip 3 • Understanding Bitcoin: What bitcoin is, the problem it fixes, and why its the solution [https://youtu.be/pBmK3pI7uKw?si=n59JkGuJ\_gP\_dEd5](https://youtu.be/pBmK3pI7uKw?si=n59JkGuJ_gP_dEd5)

Clip 4 • Keep your wealth indefinitely: Why you never need to sell bitcoin. [https://youtu.be/ELov-pumN0A?si=z0xftv1QsSKE8R66&t=373](https://youtu.be/ELov-pumN0A?si=z0xftv1QsSKE8R66&t=373)

1. Self custody. I can currently trade on decentralised exchanges without giving them ownership of my crypto. The same principle works for transactions. In theory, the intermediary never needs to have custody of the crypto. It's a digital contract which only finalises when the other party handshakes.

Whether tx fees alone will be enough to secure the network is a different question though.

OP was specifically asking about the block *subsidy* being lost in 2140. 

Any way you look at it, even if fees don't rise at all, the subsidy will be irrelevant by then.

By the time we reach 2140, the block *subsidy* will have been under 100 sats for the previous *28 years*.

Meanwhile, even with the *current* median fee rates of ~1-3 sats/vB, the total block *fees* (excluding subsidy) still add up to ~0.01-0.03 BTC.

Bitcoin is a Protocol.
It is basically a Ledger that keeps track of entries and who 'owns' that entry.
You can prove you own an entry by submitting a secret key to the protocol.

We call those 'private keys'.

There are a lot of other things around it, like encryption to make sure the system is safe, the way 'new' Satoshis are brought in circulation, and so on.

The entries also contain a number, a number that expresses the amount of Satoshis that entry contains/represents.
100 million Satoshis are defined as one Bitcoin, and the total amount of Bitcoin that can ever be in existence is just below 21 million.

If you prove to the protocol you are the owner of an entry, you can request to write some amount of Satoshis (to a maximum you own) to another entry in the ledger.
That new entry can be controlled by you or by someone else.

Some uniek properties are that nobody owns the protocol.
The system works without some centralized control, so there are no people involved in any transaction.

This means 'nobody' can change things nor influence any transaction you want to do.
It has no opening hours, no helpdesk, no CEO.

This whole thing seems to be the best solution so far to some stupid human problem ""what is the best money"".

This is ""only"" 100k - 200k$ in rewards per block for the miner whereas it is over 350k$ today.

in 100years you probably need much more energy and compute to stay competitive (moores law). with only 100-200k$ in rewards this is not sustainable. even today its very hard to be profitable with available mining hardware. furthermore you basically need free / cheap energy (today its below 8cent / kwh).

I mainly use my miner for heating the house. The rewards are a bonus. But ya... a thermal heat pump would be much more efficient. So all i can say is I'm doing this as a hobby and not making any profit.

Don't believe what strangers say about a project. When you learn about true fundamentals you can then do your own research into any project and see if they are good fundamentals or not. Then apply critical thinking to the information that you discover for yourself. This way you'll be safe. Look at the fundamentals of projects like BTC ETH and XMR. And use that as a benchmark when looking at anything else. 

Also learn about security of your assets. Personal online security is extremely important when diving into crypto. What are public keys? What are private keys? What is a seed phrase?  Knowing these things and how to keep them secure is vital. Get yourself a good password manager like keepassxc and have a good strong master password that will encrypt all your sensitive information.

That's surveillance.

I agree with you, and as said I'm on the same side of the argument as you. But it's not the definition of a dictatorship. It's surveillance.

The UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy with established checks and balances. That literally means it can't become a dictatorship. Be careful with your words and check their meanings, is all I'm saying.

 Because as someone on the same side as your argument, it ruins our credibility of arguing against the things happening, by using the wrong, exaggerated language.



There have been plenty of writeups on this recently, 
""While concerns about the concentration of power in the UK are valid, the UK is not on a path towards becoming a dictatorship. The country's constitutional framework, electoral system, and independent judiciary provide significant safeguards against such a development. However, it is important to be aware of the trends towards executive dominance and to ensure that parliamentary oversight and accountability remain strong.

The important thing is that you understand well what you are buying. If you think Bitcoin is just a way to “make quick money,” you are already on the wrong path. Bitcoin is first and foremost a decentralized protocol that no one can ban, stop or manipulate at will, and this is what gives it value.

Regarding the $5 a day: you are basically doing DCA (dollar cost averaging), that is, you buy a little every day without looking at the price. It's a sensible approach if you have a long horizon, because it protects you from getting fooled by market timing.

For the platform: any large and reliable exchange is fine to start with, the important thing is that you then learn to move your bitcoins to your own wallet, because ""not your keys, not your coins"".

Before starting, I recommend just two things:
	1. Be well informed about how Bitcoin works, not just the price.
	2. Decide on a accumulation plan that you are confident you can maintain without stressing out.

The rest comes by itself.",2,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mtemah/beginner_buyer/n9b8pu6/,False

I recommend reading and learning about bitcoin. You can get started here: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/getting-started.html

After you read and learn a bit and you feel comfortable taking custody of your bitcoin, then I recommend you to withdraw your bitcoin from the exchange each time you have accumulated at least 0.01 BTC on the exchange.

There are some good open source software wallets available but if you do not have very good computer security habits, then I highly recommend you to use a hardware wallet to store your bitcoin instead of a software wallet. And most people don't have very good computer security habits. So I'm not going to bother listing any of the good open source software wallets unless you specifically ask me to.

Some good hardware wallet options are the [Coldcard Q](https://coldcard.com/q), [BitBox02 Bitcoin-only edition](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/), [Blockstream Jade Plus](https://blockstream.com/jade/jade-plus/), [Trezor Safe 5 Bitcoin-only](https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-5-bitcoin-only), and [Foundation Passport Core](https://foundation.xyz/passport-core/).

It will get you keeping a close eye on price movement, increase your interest which will lead to you doing your own research, and will kick off rule number 1: Time in the market is better than timing the market. Also this establishes your own buying average, so as the weeks go on and you find your average, you may notice a dip in the prince eventually. That’s when you do rule number 2: Buy the dip, lower your average. Once you start continuing with this pattern, you’ll get in the rhythm and be a crypto princess in no time. Then all you have to do is rule number 3: hodl. (Hold on for dear life).

> The conversion process, called Payment Abstraction, automates this workflow. It uses Chainlink’s own services — price feeds for fair conversion rates, automation to trigger transactions, and CCIP to consolidate fees from different chains — before swapping into LINK via decentralized exchanges.

I wouldn't be so quick to pat yourself on the back for not being scammable. It's probably more  correlated to your education and being born into enough technology. Not ever person grows up how you did.

I've also been scammed exactly 0 times.... but I speak to people everyday that have lost life changing amounts of money. It's a serious issue.

Yes but this waiver doesn't stop customers taking banks through long arduous complaints processes and it doesn't remove their right to then take them to the ombudsman. Once again costing the banks thousands of dollars.

However 2 billion walked out the door in Australia with most of it being investment scams. Losing this amount of money to your citizens has large impacts across society.

Now you can raise your personal responsibility flag and say "" ah see your fault"" but there are people and institutions out there, unlike yourself who care about this stuff and want to put in place systems that help prevent people losing their retirement or their kids inheritance.

Honestly, if you're unable to find a way to buy Crypto without hassle, then you probably need to sort your shit out a lil more.

It'll happen both ways all the time. It's just a part of the way crypto goes. 

I was telling myself that there's no way we break through ATH on the first try and that we had four consecutive days of extreme greed and such a crazy pump, I should have sold a little bit more and put myself in a better position.

But as long as this is just the corrective higher low on our way towards breaking all-time high, then there's really no issue.

Also the amount of people who withdraw stolen money through crypto is really high.

Ultimately the bank is protecting itself against scam losses and regulators.

And I want to tell you the difference because these apps are not alike. BlueWallet is an open source bitcoin wallet. Phantom is a closed source shitcoin wallet. Kraken is a cryptocurrency exchange. 

BlueWallet is a good open source bitcoin wallet for mobile phones. A few good choices of open source software wallets for computers are Sparrow, Electrum, and Wasabi. But I don't recommend you to use a software wallet on your computer to store your bitcoin unless you have very good computer security habits.

If you do not have very good computer security habits, then I highly recommend you to use a hardware wallet to store your bitcoin instead of a software wallet. Some good hardware wallet options are the Coldcard Q, BitBox02 Bitcoin-only edition, Blockstream Jade Plus, Trezor Safe 5 with Bitcoin-only firmware, Foundation Passport Core, and SeedSigner.

Unless each Bitcoin is worth an ungodly amount of money and the fractions of Bitcoin issued are still valuable enough to cover operational expenses.

It's a deflationary asset which means people will hoard them. Clearly most transacting will take place layer two, not only for instant settlement but to avoid rising base layer fees.

Jointly managed by the SEC and Bank of Thailand, the sandbox seeks to boost the economy and position Thailand as a crypto-friendly destination.

This trend aligns with BRICS' plans to launch a new currency in 2026, aiming to reduce reliance on the dollar. At the 17th BRICS Summit, members agreed to develop digital payment systems and expand trade using local currencies. The bloc, now BRICS-10, represents 46% of the global population and 37% of GDP, strengthening its push for an alternative financial system outside SWIFT.

Bitcoin can only do 7TPS. If demand for transactions is above 7TPS a backlog will build. This backlog causes fees to spike higher and delays in confirmation. Since supply can’t expand, the only way the backlog comes down is if demand drops. Which it will be forced to do because users will not wait days/weeks or an indefinite or undetermined and pay sky high fees to make a transaction. 

So that means demand will always, except for brief periods, be less than supply, which means fees will always be low. Users will not voluntarily pay higher fees than they are required to, and with demand less than supply, they will always be able to get into a block for cheap.

This means the security budget is destined to be too low, which means the network will eventually fail.",3,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mt12tl/jack_dorsey_advocates_for_bitcoin_use_as_everyday/n99uu1j/,False

All these alt coins with sooo much “use case” drastically under perform large cap coins and random shit/meme coins. The “use case” narrative has played out. There are tons of coins with supposed use case and alot are legitimate use case scenarios but the market doesnt care. Thats because overall this is still a super speculative market. 

And big money isnt buying small to mid market cap  “use case” coins. Big money is flowing into the top dogs. Bitcoin,eth,sol etc… and there is not enough retail money in the market like there was back in late 2020 early 2021. Ya know from all the stimulus checks,extra money on ppls unemployment checks etc…and there isnt that massive influx of new “investors”/new money coming in from everyone being locked down. Having nothing better to do then try to act like they are day traders and dump (lose) dollar after dollar  into coins trying to make a play. A majority of those people done lost their money and have exited the market years ago. So crypto has lost all that extra free government money as well as alot of investors/traders in general compared to the previous bullrun. 

We also cant forget to mention leverage. A somewhat big factor in my opinion. The market was so extremely over leveraged in the 2020-2021 days which allowed ungodly amounts of money to move around the market. Of course after the house of cards came tumbling down  (Terra Luna, FTX, 3AC, BlockFi etc) all that leverage/money was wiped out. And things have gotten more strict since then due to various rules and regulations. 

So Ur only hope of holding anything like ergo is that something massive happens or takes place and crypto twitter (X) latches on and creates the hype to get everyone interested and buying it. Otherwise ur only other hope is lotto plays. Buying into new coins and hoping they eventually pop. I mean  if ergo got listed on major Cex’s that would generate some (short lived) interest and likely make the price move but not “wen lambo” types of moves. 

Sorry for the rambling. Thats just immediately what came to mind after reading your post. Obviously i could be completely wrong with my gauge of the market now vs last bull run so take what i say with a grain of salt. Hope ergo does play out for u tho and u make the big bucks!",3,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mt5284/after_years_of_pain_ergo_is_at_1_again_do_we/n99uhms/,False

While BTC recently hit a new all-time high, ETH has not yet surpassed its 2021 peak, despite a 22% monthly rise and reaching its highest price in nearly four years. Santiment suggests that ETH's investor base has shown less bullish sentiment, which could indicate further upside. Increased institutional demand, including billions in ETH acquisitions and ETF inflows, supports this outlook. ETH's recent performance contrasts with BTC's peak euphoria phase, hinting at more room for growth.

Even DCA is not the best strategy. Statistically, nothing beats lump sum as early as you can, even at ATH prices. (You're more likely to quickly reach a new ATH soon when one was just established vs when way down).


Interesting stat: for a randomly chosen  point in time from 2013 and to 2024 (when I did the experiment), if you bought lump sum you'll be a little under 45% up p.a. on average.

These are choices you have to make. But BTC gives you an opportunity to resist these oppressive regimes and laws in ways fiat simply does not. I’m no hero. I have no desire to be tossed in prison. But governments can *already* send you to jail, or make transactions extraordinarily difficult, or seize your funds,  or whatever, in the fiat system that we already have. And they routinely do. All sorts of purchases or dealings with people or orgs on “the bad list” are already prevented in the current system. Accounts are closed, funds are seized, people are tossed in prison all the time, and very easily with the predominant system right now. But unlike with fiat btc gives you a way to circumvent these obstacles. A government can make your life miserable. Full stop. I am acknowledging that. But nobody on earth can unilaterally take your bitcoin if properly secured, nor can they prevent you from sending or receiving it if you have an internet connection. They cannot close your “bitcoin account”. Can they threaten you with prison if you dont give up the goods? Absolutely. But they can’t just take it, like they can with fiat. This is an incredibly meaningful distinction. Again, I agree , most people in an authoritarian regime don’t want to be on the bad side of the state. But your objection to bitcoin can’t be “well it won’t work because they’ll stop it just like they do with fiat” when bitcoin gives you concrete tools that make it impossible for them to. Whether you wield those tools and take on the associated risk is up to every individual. But these 2 things are not the same.

What I think is what will work will be a blend of the strengths of both decentralized systems and centralized systems. Trust and settlement solved on bitcoin no custody risk, netting solved with LN, Asset issuance solved by taproot, and scale solved by centralized solutions.

Although Id like to see it completely decentralized, the power of centralized databases to scale are probably going to be leveraged when our species finally figures it out.

But if your goal is to centralize control into a single data center, this is exactly what you would do. Make decentralization difficult for people with poor connections to join the network.

Understanding the traditional monetary system and how it solves scaling is crucial. In this space, there appears to be limited understanding of market infrastructure and traditional finance system operations, particularly regarding the role of clearinghouses.

Clearinghouses and cryptocurrencies face similar capacity issues, requiring layered system solutions. For instance, Fedwire and ACH can only handle limited transactions simultaneously. These systems are append-only, similar to blockchain technology - when you send a wire transfer, it cannot be reversed, just like cryptocurrency transactions.

The base layer wire system solves custody risk, which is an improvement, but still faces clearinghouse capacity limitations. The global financial system addresses this through layers of clearinghouses, including sovereign clearinghouses and various clearing networks. America uses ACH domestically for retail and fed wire for large sums between banks, while SWIFT handles global transfers - both being slow and expensive systems that cryptocurrency aims to expedite.

To scale, banks use netting and 2 different messaging systems. They compress all the transatctions between each other and send one. then update their internal accounts of their customers after. It's a hub and spoke model to get a national, centralized  electronic currency to scale.

Cryptocurrency also eliminates the need for the Eurodollar system, which countries use for large international trade settlements. Without custody risk, there's no need for this intermediary system that prevents transaction reversals in major international trades while eliminating the sanction ability of the central authority, currently, America. What is also important to note, to solve liquidity issues,in this space, you need the repo market for short term treasury loans. International trade via Eurodollar runs on 2 separate clearing systems.

The scaling problem for clearing has been solved but remains poorly implemented. Solutions like netting and multiple clearing systems exist but aren't widely adopted. The concept of scaling a single clearing system to handle global transaction capacity is impractical. Instead, different layers of responsibility are needed, similar to how a rocket uses different stages to address various challenges in space travel.

Claiming the correct spec deviated from Satoshi's plan is dogmatic. Mis guided zealotry that pollutes this space, people claiming to properly interpret the white paper as if they were golden idol high priests for religious scripture. Grow up. Put your head down and do some real engineering and bring solutions instead of bitching. Protocols need to evolve as they collide with real world use case. Satoshi is gone. The tech is open source.

Advocating for a single layer solution to this gigantic scaling problem, which it is, the traditional finance sector and world governments have spent trillions since the 70s to get what we have today with about 2 billion people with out access to essential financial services, is ignorant at best and bad faith at worst.",1,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mt12tl/jack_dorsey_advocates_for_bitcoin_use_as_everyday/n98muva/,False

CryptoCurrency,1mt12tl,n98hije,1755462028.0,2025-08-17T20:20:28+00:00,juddylovespizza,"Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 Bitcoin whitepaper, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” explicitly positions Bitcoin as a form of currency, specifically electronic cash.

The title itself calls Bitcoin “electronic cash”.

The abstract opens with:

“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”

The paper describes Bitcoin as a payment system, designed to allow small transactions and eliminate the need for trusted intermediaries.

The section on transactions frames Bitcoin in terms of buyers, sellers, and payments, clearly about exchange of value, like a currency.

The scalability discussion even mentions “typical transaction sizes” (like 100 bytes), which implies it was envisioned for day-to-day use, not just a store of value.

Satoshi did not describe Bitcoin as a speculative asset or “digital gold” in the whitepaper. Those narratives evolved later as adoption shifted and limitations (like scalability and volatility) became more obvious.

Literally, read the whitepaper",12,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1mt12tl/jack_dorsey_advocates_for_bitcoin_use_as_everyday/n98hije/,False

Congrats on the move, it's never too late, [despite new people thinking otherwise](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rskpuf/i_have_only_600_bitcoinsi_missed_the_bus/). ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. 

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. 

Now, don't buy some fake bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill 

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. There's a newer version called Jade Plus, it has much better camera and overall is a better, although a bit more expensive, option. 

You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous.  

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the government is exploring such pathways, including revaluing gold reserves or reallocating other assets, but no new BTC purchases are planned yet.

But it’s nigh impossible for them to prevent the transfer of BTC among individuals. If you have Internet access (or even if you don’t but want to get creative) you can exchange BTC with anyone else who is willing to do so with you. Currently most people, if they know about or have Bitcoin at all, think of it only in terms of its fiat value. But many (and more every year) have no desire to ever convert their bitcoin back into fiat. They hold Bitcoin, they will exchange goods and services for Bitcoin, they only care to acquire more bitcoin. A government might try and punish you for possessing Bitcoin or try to coerce/punish you into giving it up but they simply cannot just take it from your wallet (if properly secured) nor stop anyone from getting on the network, creating an address, receiving BTC, or sending it if they have some.

Brandt’s endorsement adds credibility, though factors like ETF flows and global liquidity could impact the timeline and price. Investors are cautioned about the market's volatility.

Meanwhile, institutions like Bitmine are aggressively accumulating ETH, with Bitmine adding 106,485 ETH worth $470 million to its holdings. On-chain data shows a divide in behavior, with early investors cashing out and institutions treating the dip as a buying opportunity. Dormant wallets and large funds are also reshuffling positions, highlighting contrasting strategies between retail and institutional players in the crypto market.

Why would you ask internet strangers to answer a question you could find out for yourself in seconds?

--------

1. How transactions are created and signed with private/public keys

A Bitcoin wallet generates a key pair:

Private key → kept secret, used to sign.

Public key → hashed into a Bitcoin address.


When Alice sends 1 BTC to Bob:

She creates a transaction input that references her unspent output (UTXO).

She signs the transaction with her private key using ECDSA/Schnorr.

Signature proves she controls the funds without revealing her private key.

---

2. How they’re broadcast to the network and stored in mempool

The signed transaction is broadcast to neighboring Bitcoin nodes via peer-to-peer gossip.

Each node:

Verifies the signature, checks for double spends, and ensures the input is valid.

If valid → stores it in the mempool (pending transactions).


Invalid transactions are dropped.

---

3. How miners pick transactions and form a block

Miners select transactions from the mempool, prioritizing those with higher fees per vByte.

They construct a block:

Starts with a coinbase transaction (block subsidy + transaction fees).

Adds selected transactions.

Builds a Merkle tree of all transactions → root stored in block header.

---

4. How the nonce is generated and tested against the target difficulty

The block header includes:

Version, previous block hash, Merkle root, timestamp, difficulty target, nonce.


Miner changes the nonce and other small fields (e.g., coinbase extraNonce).

Double SHA-256 of header must be < target difficulty.

This trial-and-error process is Proof-of-Work.

---

5. Who decides/assigns this target value (and how difficulty adjusts)

The target adjusts every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks):

If blocks came in too fast (< 10 min avg) → difficulty increases.

If too slow → difficulty decreases.


The formula compares actual time for 2016 blocks vs. ideal (20160 minutes).

This keeps block time around 10 minutes.

---

6. How Proof of Work ensures consensus

PoW makes it costly to propose blocks (electricity + hardware).

Honest miners extend the longest valid chain (most accumulated work).

Attackers would need to outpace the global network’s hash power to rewrite history.

This creates Nakamoto Consensus.

---

7. How the block is validated by other nodes and added to the chain

When a miner finds a valid block, it’s broadcast.

Other nodes:

Check PoW is valid.

Verify each transaction.

Ensure the block follows consensus rules (size, structure, difficulty, no double spends).

If valid → block added to local blockchain copy.

Nodes then forward the block to peers.

---

8. How immutability is maintained (why changing one block breaks the chain)

Each block header contains the hash of the previous block.

Changing any transaction in a block changes its Merkle root → changes the block hash.

This invalidates all subsequent blocks.

To alter history, an attacker would need to recompute PoW for that block and all following blocks faster than the rest of the network → practically impossible.",3,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1msroz4/can_someone_explain_blockchain_like_bitcoin_in/n97d9uh/,False

Also, whales are already moving their money out of BTC into ETH. Even retail money is started to fade as people see ETH as having more upside potential. 

After ETH peaks, people move their money into alts and when they max out, into stable coins. Then we have crypto winter

1. Alice creates a transaction in her wallet, signing it with her private key and linking it to her public key.

2. The transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network and stored in the mempool (a waiting area).

3. Miners pick transactions from the mempool and include them in a candidate block.

4. To add the block to the blockchain, miners must solve a Proof of Work puzzle by finding a nonce that produces a valid hash under the current difficulty target.

5. The difficulty automatically adjusts every 2016 blocks to keep the average block time around 10 minutes.

6. Once a valid block is mined, other nodes verify it and then add it to their copy of the blockchain.

For me, it’s the former and I made my choice based on that preference, while understanding that avoidance of one kind of pain increases the likelihood of the other.",2,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mssktu/best_time_to_invest_a_sizeable_chunk_of_money_in/n97282t/,False

It acts as a method to avoid chainlink becoming centralized garbage. If you missed out on staking, you can stake once the staking pool becomes larger. With the reserve rewards drip feeds the network, so that it survives until real fees show up, and those always end up in link, no matter if say a banks pay in USD, ETH, or whatever token they wanna use.

not gonna name them all but I predict QNT will suffer in this bear market. When it drops I encourage everybody to buy and hold at least 20 QNT. It is one of the easiest token’s you can study and easily see it will be worth $15K-$100K by 2030-2035. It’s proven in the past it moves up price action wise off the market cap increasing for Crypto. 

Bitcoin has been dangerously hyped up and will likely explode to $1M+ by 2030-3032. I predict QNT will capture the marker cap increase plus it’s utility and head between $15K-$100K a token by that time. It’a a guaranteed outcome only 20 QNT will be cheap in the bear market please do not miss out.

Big money would be happy if bitcoin 3x in the next 10 years, because that's far more than what they can get in bonds (which right now is 52.67%), after risk adjusting it, that means if bitcoin were to yield 60% in 10 years, it'd be a bad deal because it's way riskier than bonds.

My guess is that big money is expecting bitcoin to return MORE than Nasdaq, since its risk is bigger. That means they expect bitcoin to return more than 16.7%, let's say 25%, that could mean bitcoin touching 360k by August 2030 would be acceptable for big money.

What I mean is, that institutional money is flowing in, doesn't mean they expect 150k in 3 months, or in 10 months or in 2 years.

Cash App, Coinbase, Gemini, and Bitstamp all have a BitLicense and all four of these exchanges allow New York residents to withdraw their bitcoin to their own wallet.

You have [Benjamin Lawsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Lawsky) to thank for this because he created the BitLicense.

Benjamin Lawsky created the BitLicense and then stepped down and [opened his own law firm that advises companies on digital currencies like bitcoin.](https://nypost.com/2015/05/20/ny-financial-watchdog-ben-lawsky-leaving-to-start-firm/)

This, after his office refused to release the research and analysis during the review of the bitLicense, in violation of his own office's policies. This was specifically requested from his office by several different people and they were all ignored.

""According to Harper, Lawsky’s office violated New York’s Freedom of Information Law by refusing to release the research and analysis that it claimed to have done to validate the BitLicense regulation, and framed the regulatory discussion in a way that other regulators have felt obliged to copy.""

He attributes recent price action to spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and treasury firm purchases, with large institutions and sovereign wealth funds driving demand. McClurg also anticipates Federal Reserve rate cuts in September and October. Other experts, like Michael Saylor and Matt Hougan, remain optimistic about Bitcoin's long-term growth, dismissing the likelihood of another bear market soon.
