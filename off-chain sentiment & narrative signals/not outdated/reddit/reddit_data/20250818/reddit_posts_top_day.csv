Last time after the CPI report in may I moved a bit and it bounced, and once more a little when the Fed hinted at pausing rates, so I think I got a slightly better feel for these swings than usual.  
  
this recent drop doesnt feel permanent, just people freaking out over inflation numbers and the fed talks. When the market recovers next month, could use the loan to move into a few things without selling my ETH and maybe even pick up more before it bounces.  
  
borrowing is not free, interest adds up, but Ive got some backup just in case I need it, so no risk of getting liquidated. honestly rates arent bad and id rather have liquidity than sell and lock in losses, even if its just a short term play. ethereum upgrades could shake things up too, maybe push price up if staking incentives kick in or gas fees drop, who knows.",3,0.71,9,https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1mthfsj/crypto_loan_while_the_market_is_acting_weird/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1mthfsj/crypto_loan_while_the_market_is_acting_weird/,False,False,False,False,

It‚Äôs easy to get distracted in the noise.

But whenever I zoom out, I always end up back at the same place: **Bitcoin**. It‚Äôs not the fastest chain, not the flashiest tech, and definitely not the trendiest narrative. Yet, it‚Äôs the one asset that has consistently proven it can survive every cycle, every attack, every ‚ÄúBitcoin is dead‚Äù article.

What keeps me hooked is how simple it really is. A decentralized, borderless store of value that no one controls. I can move it, hold it, save it, or spend it, without needing anyone‚Äôs permission. In times where inflation eats up savings and trust in traditional finance feels shaky, Bitcoin makes more sense than ever.

Of course, the price volatility can be wild. I‚Äôve learned to just zoom out, stack little by little, and not overthink the day-to-day moves. For me, it‚Äôs less about quick gains and more about building something for the long run.

Curious to hear from the community, what keeps *you* holding Bitcoin after all these years?

ethtrader,1mtcc6r,1755491534.0,2025-08-18T04:32:14+00:00,DrRobbe,Tip Leaderboard - Week 33,"Hey all,

In this post only data is included which was generate between¬†**11.08.2025**¬†until¬†**now**¬†(18.08.2025).

Last week¬†**49**¬†**(+8)**¬†user send tips and¬†**146 (+22)**¬†user received tips, with  
**- 1234**¬†tips send¬†**(+128)**  
**- 3008.2**¬†donuts send¬†**(+1200.5)**

(..): Difference to last week.

The¬†**1234** tips, were send with an average tip weight of¬†**0.902.**

Found¬†**154**¬†**(+17)** different users in tip data of the week.

Most tips send this week from one person to another:¬†**kirtash93 send 18.0 tips to DBRiMatt.**  
Most donuts send this week from one person to another:¬†**aminok send 500.0 donuts to Atorcran**.

On average¬†**25.2**¬†**(-1.8)**¬†tips were send per user.  
On average¬†**61.4¬†(-17.5)**¬†donuts were send per user.

Activity for tips picked up a little, but is still way lower than a month ago. I assume it picked up due to the special membership introduced in this week. Only 11 people got more than 20 tips in that week.

The the following tables are cut at 100 entries.

I decided to give this a go and started doing $5 into LINK and $5 into either Solana or PYTH, whichever wasn't at the highest at the certain time of the day. I liked PYTH as my ""rogue"" and ""risky"" shout one to hopefully one day blow up and make me money (probably will lose me money but oh well).

With that being said, are LINK and Solana a good investment at only doing $10 AUD a day (like $6/7 USD) with a sprinkle of PYTH on the side or do yall think I'll end up just losing thousands in a few years?

Most of the subreddits have top posts telling people to Hold, many educators advice people to hold...but why? 

Some pointers from me:

Bitcoin only has limited coins. Unlike dollars, Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is fixed, so it could gain value over time.

Prices move a lot in crypto. Most people who try to time the market end up buying high and selling low. Holding avoids a lot of those mistakes.

The fomo also kicks in when you sell and the value start climbing up, a psychological panic creeps in and people end up buying on a high. 

Nonetheless, Imo we don't have to pick any strategy as a hard and fast rule. In many cases, just taking the profit and moving on makes perfect sense and that can many real life cases. 
It's really all about how much risk you're okay with, when you need the money considering how much you have invested.

I recognised it immediately as a scam as I had provided an incorrect name when I had purchased my Ledger.

The letter itself is very authentic-looking, mentioning that Ledger is supposedly introducing a thing called ""Transaction Check"" that needs to be enabled on your Ledger device. It provides a QR code which of course goes to a scam URL (ledger.verify-transaction-check.com) which presumably asks you for your seed phrase (I did not click on the link as it likely personally identifies the recipient). 

After a bit of investigation, I believe I managed to get Cloudflare to shut it down, as they were using these services to hide the underlying web host. This has hopefully saved some people from being scammed. 
I'm hoping that since they now can't hide their web host, it will mean no further people will be at risk. For additional measure, I have also reported it to Google Safe Browsing so any browsing to that URL regardless of web-host will be met with a big warning.

It looks like these guys have spent some time and money on this campaign. The letter has a local stamp which seemingly indicates that it's being conducted from within my country.

If anyone gets these sorts of mails, I would highly encourage them to take similar action by reporting these sites either here or directly to the host site (if you are knowledgeable on how to get this information). The quicker this community reacts to this sort of stuff, hopefully these scammers will realise it's not a profitable enterprise anymore.

It's been a while since anything exciting has really happened.

For those that like to play around with new networks, we take a look at Katana, a ZK Rollup built on Polygons Agglayer.

https://preview.redd.it/pj3r1dvmiojf1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bbf07bf0add4342fa72f70cfc1f9345b3e00e41

Basic Tokenomics

* 10b KAT supply will been minted
* 70m KAT is earmarked for users that pre-deposited liquidity
* 1.5b KAT is allocated to the community
* 1b KAT is allocated for core apps only to incentivize users
* KAT will be transferable no later than February 20, 2026, hopefully sooner

You can bridge to Katana via their native bridge [https://bridge.katana.network/](https://bridge.katana.network/)

Mainnet has been live for a little over a month now; and [Sushi.com](http://Sushi.com) supports Katana Network.

You can supply liquidity on pools such as the ETH/USDC pool to earn KAT + SUSHI tokens

https://preview.redd.it/u0brct2njojf1.png?width=274&format=png&auto=webp&s=60f6e7774a8cd35fff940daf6a81f8cd7caa2ab9

Interacting with the network will likely also help contribute to any potential airdrop of KAT tokens.  
  
Often this can be a case of making atleast 10 transactions over different days, over a couple of months.

But that's not all. Users who stake/restake on [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) can also deposit into the liquid vault.

And finally, there will also be a portion of community allocated tokens that go towards Polygon stakers!

You can see that here [https://staking.polygon.technology/community-drops](https://staking.polygon.technology/community-drops)

Of course, always be cautious following X and Discord, stay vigilant and look at Official sources, as airdrops often attract bad actors with clone websites or fake social accounts.

Like most people, I first thought about using Binance, since it‚Äôs the biggest exchange.

But while searching around, I found this article comparing Binance and Bybit: [https://st4007.com/entry/My-Honest-Experience-Why-I-Ended-Up-Using-Bybit-Instead-of-Binance](https://st4007.com/entry/My-Honest-Experience-Why-I-Ended-Up-Using-Bybit-Instead-of-Binance)

The article mentions that Binance has some downsides for beginners, like stricter KYC, complicated menus, and the fact that in the US you can only use [Binance.US](http://Binance.US) (which has fewer features). On the other hand, Bybit seems to have a simpler interface and feels more beginner-friendly overall.

After reading it, I feel like Bybit might actually be easier for someone just starting out.

What do you guys think?

I have an impression that VOO & Chill strategy is good when you either start early 20s, or when you have sustainable money to invest right away. 

I am finishing with the emergency fund and looking to start with investments. I have about 1500 pet month to invest. I am seriously considering 50/50 split between QQQM and BTC. 

I don‚Äôt believe BTC will ever replace fiat, but I do believe in a new type of asset in a form of a digital gold. I‚Äôve been watching BTC since 2017, but never got extra money to put in. I don‚Äôt want to watch it another 8 years and missing out again. 

I know people in this sub are often going with 100 BTC, but this is too much for me. My logic in 50/50 is that if BTC continues to grow, I‚Äôll be in a good shape in 5-10 years.

Story Protocol, a pioneering Layer 1 (L1) blockchain platform leveraging AI to transform intellectual property (IP) management, recently announced a significant leadership transition. Co-founder Jason Zhao is stepping back from his full-time role after 3.5 years to launch another project. This development, set against the backdrop of Story Protocol‚Äôs $134‚Äì$140 million in funding from prominent investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Endeavor, and Samsung Ventures, underscores the need for vigilance when investing in emerging L1 projects, even those backed by high-profile venture capitalists (VCs).

This case exemplifies the inherent risks associated with emerging Layer 1 blockchain projects. Leadership transitions, particularly following significant funding rounds, can generate uncertainty regarding a project‚Äôs stability and capacity to achieve its objectives. Even with support from prominent venture capital firms, success is not assured.

Such instances of maximum extractions by founders are increasingly prevalent in the industry.

My small team and I have been wrestling with a problem for a while now, and I'm genuinely curious to hear this community's thoughts.
It feels like 90% of our tools are focused on purely quantitative data (price, volume, indicators), but anyone who has been in the markets long enough knows that the real driver is often the story, or the narrative, that captures people's imagination.
We see the aftermath on the charts, but the cause‚Äîthe initial capital flows, the shift in social sentiment, the moment a story starts to gain real traction‚Äîis incredibly hard to see in real time. We're always a step behind.
To try and solve this for ourselves, we've been building a tool called tradesuss. It's a simulation that attempts to analyze on-chain data and social chatter to better understand and track these market narratives.
We're getting ready to let the first group of testers in to see what we've built and help us shape it. Sign-ups for the private preview are going live tomorrow .


My question for you all is: How do you currently track narratives? What are the key signals you look for manually that you wish could be automated?

About maybe two months ago- I tried to read a type book called 'ace that test' - which I just today - It actually has no type of official book summary up to date on the internet? So maybe I should make one?

'apart from Myles AKA python programmer trying to endorse the book?

  
from the contents the 3rd part of the book 'study strategies that work - is all about actual learning method.

The rules are finally clear, and that could push stablecoins into a whole new phase, call it Stablecoin boom.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he doesn‚Äôt understand the appeal of stablecoins, but at the same time he can‚Äôt afford to stay on the sidelines, fearing to lose ground to fintech players. This statement highlights that among the US economic elite it‚Äôs simply unacceptable to miss the stablecoin trend. According to CNBC, Citi and Bank of America are also exploring plans to issue stablecoins. Amazon and Walmart are likewise considering launching their own stablecoins.

The big question: which blockchains fit this new era? Governments (CBDCs) will likely choose permissioned or hybrid chains to keep maximum control. Banks need networks that integrate with SWIFT/ISO20022 and support multi-currency cross-border payments. Businesses and retail care more about speed, low fees, and large ecosystems where stablecoins can move easily.

With regulation coming fast worldwide, the competition between blockchains could define the next decade of crypto. Which chains do you see becoming the backbone of the stablecoin boom?
